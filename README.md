# aws-services
a small project idea that involves using AWS services. It focuses on building a serverless web application to upload, store, and view images.

Services Used
Amazon S3: To store the uploaded images.
AWS Lambda: To process and validate the images upon upload.
API Gateway: To create an API endpoint for uploading images.
Amazon DynamoDB (optional): To store metadata about the uploaded images (e.g., image name, upload timestamp).
AWS CloudFront: To distribute and cache the images globally (optional for performance).

Steps to Build
1. Setup an S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket (e.g., my-image-storage-bucket).
Enable public access or use pre-signed URLs for controlled access.

2. Build a Lambda Function
Write a Lambda function in Python to validate and process the uploaded images.

3.Create an API Gateway
Use API Gateway to create an HTTP API with a POST method for uploading images.
Integrate the API with the Lambda function created earlier.

4. Frontend Setup
Create a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend for users to upload images.

5.Display Uploaded Images
Use another API or list objects from the S3 bucket and display them in the frontend.

6. Test and Deploy
Test the application by uploading images via the frontend and verifying that they appear in the S3 bucket.
Deploy the frontend (using services like AWS Amplify or a simple web server).
